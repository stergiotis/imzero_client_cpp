# Changelog

### Breaking changes:
* Remove `imgui_glfw`, a demonstration of the imzero ipc protocol using stock ImGui rather than the Skia backend imgui contained in this repository.                                
* Remove colored buttons. The style is alien to the rest of ImGui, and the code is crusty and unmaintained.

### Changes:
* Fixing window decoration.
* Compile on SteamOS 3.6.
* Use SDL 3.2.4.
* Use ImGui v1.91.9 wip.
* Update other minor dependencies.
